However, there are three restrictions on the format of the password:\n","\n","1. it has to contain only alphanumerical characters (a−z, A−Z, 0−9);\n","2. there should be an even number of letters;\n","3. there should be an odd number of digits.\n","\n","\n","You are given a string S consisting of N characters. String S can be divided into words by splitting it at, and removing, the spaces. The goal is to choose the longest word that is a valid password. You can assume that if there are K spaces in string S then there are exactly K + 1 words.\n","\n","For example, given \"test 5 a0A pass007 ?xy1\", there are five words and three of them are valid passwords: \"5\", \"a0A\" and \"pass007\". Thus the longest password is \"pass007\" and its length is 7. Note that neither \"test\" nor \"?xy1\" is a valid password, because \"?\" is not an alphanumerical character and \"test\" contains an even number of digits (zero).\n","\n","Write a function:\n","\n","def solution(S)\n","\n","that, given a non-empty string S consisting of N characters, returns the length of the longest word from the string that is a valid password. If there is no such word, your function should return −1.\n","\n","For example, given S = \"test 5 a0A pass007 ?xy1\", your function should return 7, as explained above.\n","\n","Assume that:\n","\n","N is an integer within the range [1..200];\n","string S consists only of printable ASCII characters and spaces.\n","In your solution, focus on correctness.
